I am a Data Engineer currently working at [Roblox](http://roblox.com).
I received my PhD at [UQ](http://uq.edu.au) in the [Australian Centre for Ecogenomics](http://ecogenomic.org). Throughout my PhD I was at the
interface of microbial ecology, chemical engineering, and computational
biology and have gained many skills ranging from microscopy, reactor
operation and computer programming.

During my PhD, I developed many data analysis skills, including
statistical inference, programming, and developing novel bioinformatics
algorithms. I further honed these skills as a postdoctoral researcher
at Caltech developing a SQL database to integrate diverse data
sources while mentoring PhD students in bioinformatics.

I transitioned to working in industry at Second Genome where I used
my bioinformatics knowledge to implement scalable data analysis
workflows in AWS. At Pendulum Therapeutics I was involved in
all aspects of the software and data stack including full-stack
development of internal web applications, ETL and ELT pipelines,
data warehousing, third-party data integrations, deployment/devops
on AWS, and reporting and analytics.

I’m fluent in Python, however I have written software in diverse
languages including Javascript, Typescript, Perl, R, Smalltalk,
Java, and C++. As part of my duties I regularly collaborate with
members of the scientific team and with non-technical members of
the company to understand user requirements and build solutions for
laboratory and manufacturing teams. I am passionate about analysis
automation, eﬀicient data processing, and believe strongly in version
control, test-driven development, and literate programming techniques
to ensure reproducibility.
