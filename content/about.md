I am a Data Engineer currently working at [Pendulum Therapeutics](http://pendulum.co) . I received my PhD at [UQ](http://uq.edu.au) in the [Australian Centre for Ecogenomics](http://ecogenomic.org). Throughout my PhD I was at the interface of microbial ecology, chemical engineering, and computational biology and have gained many skills ranging from microscopy, reactor operation and computer programming. I love looking at genomes and developing hypotheses on ecology and physiology based on genomic data. My current role is developing and engineering serverless bioinformatics pipelines using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), however my background in molecular biology allows me to effectively work in collaboration with wet-lab scientists and to place the inferences of metagenomic data into a broader biological framework.
