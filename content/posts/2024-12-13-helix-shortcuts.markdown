Writing these down because I always forget...


## Replace all occurances of something

1. create a selection. For example, using <kbd>x</kbd> for lines, <kbd>v</kbd> for a flexible selection, or <kbd>%</kbd> for the whole file
2. search in the selection with <kbd>s</kbd> followed by whatever you want to search for, then <kbd>enter</kbd>
3. (this will create a whole bunch of cursors) use <kbd>c</kbd> to change the text and enter insert-mode to replace
